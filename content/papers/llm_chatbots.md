This research explores the integration of chatbot technology powered by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 Turbo into higher education to enhance internationalization and leverage digital transformation. It delves into the design, implementation, and application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for improving student engagement, information access, and support. Utilizing technologies like Python 3, GPT API, LangChain, and Chroma Vector Store, the research emphasizes creating a high-quality, timely, and relevant transcript dataset for chatbot testing. Findings indicate the chatbot's efficacy in providing comprehensive responses, its preference over traditional methods by users, and a low error rate. Highlighting the chatbot's real-time engagement, memory capabilities, and critical data access, the study demonstrates its potential to elevate accessibility, efficiency, and satisfaction. Concluding, the research suggests the chatbot significantly aids higher education internationalization, proposing further investigation into digital technology's role in educational enhancement and strategy development.
